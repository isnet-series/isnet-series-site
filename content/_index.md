# Welcome

This site is the online home of the ISNET community. The purpose of this site is to host information about past and future meetings, publications, and to maintain a base of knowledge about statistics and nuclear physics resources such as articles, textbooks, and websites.

## Mission statement

The mission of the ISNET community is to encourage, facilitate and
develop the use of statistical and computational methodologies that
maximize the knowledge gained from and quantify uncertainties in
nuclear measurements and theoretical calculations. We do this by
combining domain knowledge from the nuclear physics research community
with expertise in cognate fields of research and practice, such as
statistics, mathematics and computer science.
