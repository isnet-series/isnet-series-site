This page is dedicated to listing collected resources identified to be helpful for researchers working at the interface of nuclear physics, statistics, and applied mathematics. This will be further suborganized, but for now here are some basic resources that were identified and advertised at the 2019 meeting in Gothenburg.

- [Learning from Data: Bayesian Methods and Machine Learning](https://nucleartalent.github.io/Bayes2019/topics/exercises.html). This links to a course webpage and github repository for a Nuclear TALENT (Training in Low Energy Nuclear Theory) course held at the University of York in York, UK from June 10 to 28, 2019
- [ISNET-4 resource page](https://bayesint.github.io). A workshop on Bayesian Methods in Nuclear Physics was held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory at the University of Washington in Seattle from June 13 to July 8, 2016. These pages continue the discussion initiated at this program. The workshop was the number 4 of the ISNET (Information and Statistics in Nuclear Experiments and Theory) family of meetings. Talks given at ISNET-3 and ISNET-5 are also listed here.
