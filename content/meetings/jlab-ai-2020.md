A three-day workshop entitled ["A.I. for Nuclear Physics"](https://www.jlab.org/conference/AI2020) was held in 2020 at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, VA, USA. All talks from this meeting [can be found here](https://www.jlab.org/indico/event/357/timetable/#20200304).

A breakout session was held specifically for the nuclear structure theory working group, and those talks are hosted here for further dissemination.
