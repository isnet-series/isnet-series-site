## Meetings in 2020

### Uncertainties in Calculations of Nuclear Reactions of Astrophysical Interest

A [virtual workshop](https://indico.mitp.uni-mainz.de/event/215/) was hosted by the [Mainz Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.mitp.uni-mainz.de). 

Available talks can be found on the [timetable page](https://indico.mitp.uni-mainz.de/event/215/timetable/#20201207).

### Artificial Intelligence for Nuclear Physics 2020

A three-day workshop entitled ["A.I. for Nuclear Physics"](https://www.jlab.org/conference/AI2020) was held in 2020 at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, VA, USA. All talks from this meeting [can be found here](https://www.jlab.org/indico/event/357/timetable/#20200304).

A breakout session was held specifically for the nuclear structure theory working group, and those talks are hosted here for further dissemination.
